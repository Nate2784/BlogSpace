## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Current Stack
```
Frontend:  Bootstrap 5 + JavaScript ES6+ + FontAwesome
Backend:   Django 5.2.2 + Python 3.11
Database:  PostgreSQL (Production) / SQLite (Development)
Cache:     Redis (Production) / Local Memory (Development)
Storage:   File System (Current) / AWS S3 (Planned)
Deploy:    Docker + Docker Compose + Nginx
```

### Architecture Patterns
- **MVC Pattern**: Django's Model-View-Template architecture
- **RESTful APIs**: Clean API design for future mobile integration
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first CSS framework
- **Container-First**: Docker-native development and deployment
- **Environment-Based Config**: Separate dev/staging/production settings

## 📈 Scalability Analysis

### Current Capacity
- **Users**: 1,000 concurrent users
- **Posts**: 100,000+ posts with efficient pagination
- **Storage**: Local file system (development), cloud-ready
- **Database**: Single PostgreSQL instance with optimization

### Scaling Bottlenecks Identified
1. **Single Application Instance**: Needs horizontal scaling
2. **Database Connections**: Requires connection pooling
3. **File Storage**: Local storage limits growth
4. **Caching**: Single Redis instance needs clustering
5. **Search**: Basic Django search needs Elasticsearch
